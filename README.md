# Autocomplete

A program to implement autocomplete for a given set of N terms, where a term is a query string and an associated nonnegative weight. That is, given a prefix, find all queries that start with the given prefix, in descending order of weight. Autocomplete is pervasive in modern applications. As the user types, the program predicts the complete query (typically a word or phrase), that the user intends to type.
